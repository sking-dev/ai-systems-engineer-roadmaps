# ai-systems-engineer-roadmaps

Curated frameworks, roadmaps, and learning resources for evolving from cloud platform engineering to AI systems engineering.

Focus on building and managing the infrastructure that enables AI systems to operate effectively, securely, and responsibly.

🔧 Work in progress: Contents are in draft form and will be updated over time.

🤖 AI assistance: Parts of this content were drafted and refined with the help of AI tools, alongside a manual review process.

## Contents

- `docs/cloud_to_ai_systems_framework.md` – Strategic framework for transitioning from Cloud Platform Engineer to AI Systems Engineer
- [Foundations](#foundations) – Mapping existing cloud platform experience to AI systems engineering, including overlaps and gaps

### Pending (TBC)

- `docs/ai_infrastructure_skills_roadmap.md` – Technical skills progression for AI infrastructure engineering
- `docs/ethical_ai_systems_foundation.md` – Resources for developing an ethical foundation for AI systems engineering
- `docs/meta_level_engineering_approach.md` – Guide to the meta-level perspective of building systems for AI
- `docs/year1_ai_aware_engineer.md` – Detailed roadmap for becoming an AI-Aware Infrastructure Engineer (2026)
- `docs/year2_ai_infrastructure_specialist.md` – Progression path to AI Infrastructure Specialist (2027)
- `docs/year3_ai_platform_engineer.md` – Evolution to AI Platform Engineer (2028)
- `docs/measuring_progress.md` – Framework for evaluating progress along the AI Systems Engineering path
- `docs/learning_resources.md` – Curated list of courses, tutorials, and hands-on projects

## Getting Started

Begin with [`cloud_to_ai_systems_framework.md`](docs/cloud_to_ai_systems_framework.md) for a high-level overview of the transition journey.

Before diving into the roadmaps, review [the Foundations section](#foundations) to see how existing cloud platform skills map onto AI systems engineering.

Then explore the year-by-year roadmaps to develop a more detailed understanding of the skills and capabilities needed at each stage.

As this roadmap evolves, additional documents will be added to provide more detailed guidance for each stage of the journey.

## Foundations

These documents connect the high-level roadmaps to current skills, experience, and identified gaps.

- `docs/cloud_ai_overlap.md` – Overlap between cloud engineering and AI systems engineering, annotated with strengths and gaps
- `docs/cloud_ai_cybersecurity_overlap.md` – Overlap between cybersecurity engineering and AI systems engineering
- `docs/cloud_ai_gap_analysis.md` – Structured analysis of current gaps and priority areas
- `docs/cloud_ai_learning_plan.md` – Short-term learning and practice plan to close the gaps
